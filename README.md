## Confused by All the CSS and Sass Files?

Some basics about the Sass and CSS files that come with the theme:
- The theme itself uses the `/style.css`file only to identify the theme inside of WordPress. The file is not loaded by the theme and does not include any styles.
- The `/css/theme.css` and its minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides all styles. It is composed of five different SCSS sets and one variable file at `/sass/theme.scss`

- Your design goes into: `/sass/theme`.
  - Add your styles to the `/sass/theme/_theme.scss` file
  - And your variables to the `/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`
  - Or add other .scss files into it and `@import` it into `/sass/theme/_theme.scss`.

## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync (optional) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your downloaded theme
- Run: `npm install`
- Run: `npm install gulp`

### Running
To work with and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
{
    "browserSyncOptions" : {
        "proxy": "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
        "notify": false
    },
    ...
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`
